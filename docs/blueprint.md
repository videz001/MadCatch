## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #39FF14 (a vivid, electric green) for the interface to evoke the essence of a science lab, suggesting the use of neon and chemical reactions.
- Background color: #292533 (a very dark, desaturated violet) to complement the primary, create depth, and reinforce a modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: #D65C5C (a contrasting vivid orange-red) to highlight interactive elements such as buttons, score, and notifications, catching the userâ€™s attention and guiding them effectively through the game.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a computerized, techy feel, for all headers and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons for UI elements. Consider icons related to laboratory equipment.
- Divide the screen into clear, distinct sections for the game, wallet info, and leaderboard.
- Subtle animations when flasks drop and when the character catches them.
